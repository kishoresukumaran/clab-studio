# Welcome to containerlab studio Documentation

Welcome to the **Containerlab Studio** documentation site! This documentation provides comprehensive guides, tutorials, and reference materials to help you get started and make the most of containerlab studio.

## What is Containerlab Studio?

**Containerlab Studio** is a web-based platform designed for designing, deploying, and managing network topologies using [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/). It provides an intuitive visual interface for us to:

- Design complex network topologies with drag-and-drop interface
- Deploy topologies to multiple containerlab servers
- Deploy labs using git, remote temlpates and local temlpates
- Manage running topologies across multiple servers
- Access containers or the ceos nodes via integrated web terminal
- Monitor server health and topology status
- Manage containerlab images and templates
- View the deployed topology, Run wireshark captures on container interfaces
- Collaborate and work together on a lab using SSHX
