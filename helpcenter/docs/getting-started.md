## Quick Start Example

Here's a simple example to get you started:

1. **Use the Topology Designer**: Use the Topology Designer page to design your topology
2. **Use the Deploy**: Use the Deploy button to chose which server to deploy your topology in
3. **Use the Dashboards page**: Use the Dashboards page to access your topology and connect to your topology nodes. 
4. **View Topology & Destroy**: You can also use the topology button to view the topology of the lab. And once your work is finished, you can either chose to stop the lab (temporary stop) or chose to destroy the lab as shown below
